# [Global Stock Content Calendar](https://github.com/woliul/global-stock-content-calendar/blob/main/calendar.md)  

**[Global Stock Content Calendar](https://github.com/woliul/global-stock-content-calendar/blob/main/calendar.md)** is a comprehensive, Markdown‑native content planning toolkit designed specifically for 3D artists, illustrators, and graphic designers targeting stock marketplaces (Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, Unsplash Plus, 123RF, etc.).  

Every month features a clean table of:  
- **Date** — When the event occurs  
- **Event** — Name (with a direct link to Wikipedia for reference)  
- **Content Idea** — Actionable prompts tailored to high‑demand stock niches  
- **Keywords** — SEO‑optimized tags for maximum discoverability  
- **Visual Tips** — Color palettes, composition notes, and style cues for on‑trend 3D and illustration work  

Major “hot” stock events are flagged ⭐ to help you prioritize your best‑selling themes.  

Whether you’re a solo creator planning your annual pipeline or a team managing large‑scale content calendars, Global Stock Content Calendar lets you:  
1. **Version‑control** your ideas in plain Markdown.  
2. **Collaborate** via pull requests—add new events or refine keywords.  
3. **Integrate** with static‑site generators (e.g., via markdown‑it‑calendar).  
4. **Quickly scan** what to create—and exactly how to style it—for every key global observance.
